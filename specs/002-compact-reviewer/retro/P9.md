# Phase 9 Retrospective: Testing Review Skill

## Summary
Implemented the testing-review skill for evaluating test coverage and edge case handling in Compact contract test suites.

## Deliverables
- `skills/testing-review/SKILL.md` - Skill entry point
- `references/coverage-requirements.md` - 4-level coverage framework (60%/80%/90%/100%)
- `references/edge-case-checklist.md` - Comprehensive edge case categories

## Decisions Made
- Coverage levels tied to project criticality (prototype vs production vs audited)
- Edge case checklist organized by category: Numeric, Collections, Authorization, State, Input, ZK-Specific, Business, Errors
- ZK-specific edge cases include witness values, Merkle proofs, commitments, and disclosure

## Challenges
None - followed established skill structure from P1 skills.

## Next Phase
Phase 10: Maintainability skill implementation.
