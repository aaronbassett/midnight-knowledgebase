# Phase 8 Retrospective: Code Quality Skill

## Summary
Implemented the code-quality skill for reviewing naming conventions and code organization in Compact contracts.

## Deliverables
- `skills/code-quality/SKILL.md` - Skill entry point
- `references/naming-conventions.md` - Naming patterns for all Compact constructs
- `references/organization-guidelines.md` - File structure and layout patterns

## Decisions Made
- Naming conventions follow Compact ecosystem standards (snake_case for circuits, PascalCase for types)
- Organization guidelines include module comment format and section ordering
- Quality checklist provides quick reference for reviews

## Challenges
None - followed established skill structure from P1 skills.

## Next Phase
Phase 9: Testing Review skill implementation.
